## Uninformed Search Algorithms
You might need the models and node classes for future projects consider bookmarking the same. These only include uninformed and informed are not availabe.

## Knowledge And Logic
You might need the logic.py file for future projects consider bookmarking the same as it contains all logical operation classes and also has a separate function for model checking. These only include propositional language and model checking; first-order logic and inference by resolution is not available.

## Bayesian Network
You might need model.py so consider bookmarking it as it contain or atleast describes the basic structure of a bayesian network and you can modify it to your needs. The last part contains various ways of using it so if one of your use cases fall under that please comment the one unused and leave the ones being used uncommented.

## Markov Model
The model given is only an implementation of the markovify library and hece isn't really required but you might want to save it for further reference and see how to use the markovify library for the future.

## Hill Climbing Algorithm
You might need model.py especially the HillClimbingAlgorithm.steepest_ascent function.

## Linear Programming And Constaraint Satisfaction Problems
This folder includes 2 files: problem1.py and problem2.py; where in problem 1 involves linear programming methods and you might want to save it for the future as it describes how to use scipy for linear problems, problem 2 involves CSP and 2 solutions have been provided. It'd be helpful for the future as if you want to build a backtracking search model, it would really help out.

## Learning Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
This folder contains 2 datasets(train.csv, test.csv) and main.py runs several ML Algorithms on it. 2 plots have been provided to show the outputs(accuracy and loss). The first one is without config of KNN and second one shows what happens after max configuration of KNN; any values above 300 will give a comparatively worse accuracy. 

### Reinforcement Learning
This folder contains 2 files - nim.py which has been taken from HarvardX CS50 GitHub Repository, and the main.py is used to implement the module and make an agent for playing the game of Nim.
