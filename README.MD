## Uninformed Search Algorithms
You might need the models and node classes for future projects consider bookmarking the same. These only include uninformed and informed are not availabe.

## Knowledge And Logic
You might need the logic.py file for future projects consider bookmarking the same as it contains all logical operation classes and also has a separate function for model checking. These only include propositional language and model checking; first-order logic and inference by resolution is not available.

## Bayesian Network
You might need model.py so consider bookmarking it as it contain or atleast describes the basic structure of a bayesian network and you can modify it to your needs. The last part contains various ways of using it so if one of your use cases fall under that please comment the one unused and leave the ones being used uncommented.

## Markov Model
The model given is only an implementation of the markovify library and hece isn't really required but you might want to save it for further reference and see how to use the markovify library for the future.

## Hill Climbing Algorithm
You might need model.py especially the HillClimbingAlgorithm.steepest_ascent function.
